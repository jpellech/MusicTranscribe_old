**MusicTranscribe** will split your audio file into its various sound sources and then convert each one to midi. The output of MusicTranscribe is a .zip of each sound sources midi file as well as a chord_chart.txt, documenting each chord in the input file. MusicTranscribe is compatible with .wav, .mp3, .mp4, and .FLAC audio files. Other than source separation and midi conversion, MusicTranscribe has many other built in signal processing methods. A few examples are chromagram to audio file conversion, harmonic and percussive extraction and stereo to mono conversion.

**------Installation:-------**
Download the whole MusicTranscribe repository. 
Then, in your terminal, cd to the MusicTranscribe folder with 'cd /path/to/MusicTranscribe'.
Make sure you have poetry and flask installed on your hard drive. If you don't have poetry installed, you can do it in you terminal with 'pip install poetry' and 'pip install flask'
Now run 'poetry install' to install MusicTranscribe dependencies from the pyproject.toml. 

**------Instructions:-------**
To use MusicTranscribe from the shell, first cd to the MusicTranscribe folder in your filesystem with 'cd downloads' or 'cd desktop' and then 'cd MusicTranscribe'. poetry ensures MusicTranscribes poetry dependencies are active, so append 'poetry run' to the beginning of your command. Here is an example of a command line argument to use MusicTranscribe: 

'(base) YourName MusicTranscribe % poetry run python3 MusicAssist.py /valid/path/to/audio/file.mp3


OR, you can run MusicAssist from webpage with the following command: 'poetry run python3 flask.py' and opening the the IP address.

This would look like the following in your terminal: 

(base) YourName MusicTranscribe % 'poetry run python3 flask.py'. 

Then you can go to the webpage at the given IP address and upload your file there.
